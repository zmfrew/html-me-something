                            <p>The adventure began early on a Thursday morning rising early to catch 
                                a flight to Milwaukee. From Milwaukee, we flew to Denver in the comfort of 
                                Southwest with drinks in hand. Finally in Denver, the mountain shuttle 
                                gathered us and our belongings, and we embarked for Breckenridge. 
                                The shuttle lasted 2 hours, and we ended at our condo at the base of the mountain.</p>

                        <h3>Mountain</h3>
                            <p>Breckenridge has 6 different peaks all of which vary in difficulty and size. 
                                You can ski from one to the other, so we traversed through all of them. 
                                I will always remember the feeling of awe when I first looked down at the 
                                top of the mountain. Neither words nor pictures do the beauty justice.</p>

                        <h3>City of Breckenridge</h3>
                            <p>When we were not out on the slopes, we enjoyed the quaint city of Breckenridge. 
                                Being a small ski town at the base of the mountain, Breckenridge's streets 
                                are lined with local ski shops, boutiques, restaurants, and bars. The city 
                                comes alive at night as people leave the mountain, and the Christmas lights 
                                illuminate the snowy ground.</p>

                    <h3>Rest &amp; Recuperation</h3>
                        <p>Our condo had plenty of room for the two of us, and we had access to 2 hot tubs 
                            shared between the condom complex. We spent time in the hot tub with heavy snow 
                            fall and the mountain in the background, which was absolutely incredible.</p>

                    <p>The streets of Breckenridge are full of small restaurants and bars. As the light 
                        fades from the day, skiers frequent their favorite watering holes. Ollie's, one of 
                        the more popular establishments with hands down the best fried pickles I've 
                        ever eaten, sits in the heart of downtown. The crowd is mixed between people still 
                        wearing their skiing/snowboarding gear and those dressed casually for a nice 
                        evening on the town.</p>
